# PDX Solarpunk Collective

This website is for a collective of people who aim to do better in the world. It is inpsired by ideals of solarpunk, futurology, and afro-futurism. While we recognize the negative aspects of the world around us, we strive to focus on the positive things we can do to make a difference in ourselves, our communities and beyond.

This group will focus on themes like the following:

- Literature about uplifting the downtrodden and living in harmony with nature
- Tactical means by which to lighten our ecological footprint
- Shared resources among one another.
- A heightened awareness of local businesses who are aligned with these goals
