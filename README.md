# PDX Solarpunk Collective

This website is for a collective of people who aim to do better in the world. It is inpsired by ideals of solarpunk, futurology, and afro-futurism. While we recognize the negative aspects of the world around us, we strive to focus on the positive things we can do to make a difference in ourselves, our communities and beyond.

This group will focus on themes like the following:

- Literature about uplifting the downtrodden and living in harmony with nature
- Tactical means by which to lighten our ecological footprint
- Sharing resources/skills among one another.
- A heightened awareness of local businesses/organizations who are aligned with these goals
- Building sustainable and resilliant community outside of capitalist/consumption models
- Participation in direct/collective action, especially in service of these goals.
- Thinking through and planning for radical change to make more than step-wise improvement in the status quo.
